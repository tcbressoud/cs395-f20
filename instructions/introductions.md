# Making a Video of Introduction

Each student should make a video of introduction and should upload it to Notebowl prior to the first class of the semester at 11:30 a.m. US ET on Tuesday, August 18.

This activity accomplishes three goals:

1. First and foremost, we get to know one another.  In this time of hybrid class, it is more important than ever that we find ways to establish common ground and human connection in our classes.
2. Given that this class is about oral communication, we get early experience in recording a video, in being creative, and in getting used to seeing and hearing ourselves speak.
3. During our first day of class, we will divide into breakout groups and observe and assess each other's videos.  This mechanism of breakout and learning in smaller groups is a primary mode to be used in the course, and this will allow us to make sure the mechanisms work.

## Specification of the Video

0. Audience: class mates and your professor.  Before you engage in *any* oral communication, your first task should be to clearly identify your audience.
1. Videos should be about a couple minutes long.
2. Content is up to you, but things to think about including:
     - The "stats" of your bio, like who you are, what you like to be called, your class year, your major(s) and minor(s).
     - How you are handling this semester ... if remote, where you at and what affects your college experience, if on-campus, where you are living and how you are keeping yourself safe.
     - Sharing something about yourself, and perhaps that others might not know, but that you feel comfortable sharing.  If you do this, keep it low stakes and relatable and/or "fun".
3. Be creative and be organized.  Think about how you want to present yourself and to convey information.  We will be sharing these and discussing what we see, so we want to present ourselves well.

## Making the Video

Ultimately, you can choose any means of recording a video of your introduction that you like, as long as you can generate a video file (like a `.mp4`) that you can upload to Notebowl.  In the future, we might standardize on Loom or Zoom to take advantage of shared cloud storage and avoid downloading and uploading videos, but for now, we leave it up to you.

Below, I **briefly** describe the basic steps I took to get a video created using Loom and Zoom.  If you are having difficulty with the creation step, please **post on Notebowl**, and I would encourage **other students** with experience to reply and offer additional instructions and advice.

### Loom

1. Go to the website https://loom.com
2. Click on the "Get Loom for Free"
3. Click on "Sign up with Google"
4. If you have multiple GMail accounts, select your Denison one.
5. Click the radio button to verify that you are a student.
6. Accept terms.
7. I use Chrome, so installed the Chrome extension after selecting "Record a Video" but presumably downloading and installing the client application would work equally well.
8. In the Loom window in Chrome, I clicked "New Video"
9. In the resulting dialog, I clicked "Cam Only" and then "Start Recording"
10.  Once the recording was made, or after you iterate to get it how you like it, I was able to select my best video version and, in the set of buttons underneath the video panel was a "Download" option (the icon with a downward arrow pointing at a horizontal line segment).

### Zoom

1. Go to https://denison.zoom.us
2. Register and become part of Denison's Zoom license by starting with "Sign In" and providing your Denison single-sign-on credentials.
3. One-time installation of `zoom.us` application.  This application step might not happen until you do a "Start Meeting"
4. Start a meeting
    - In the `zoom.us` application under the "Home" tab, you will have a "New Meeting" button.
    - If you navigate back to https://denison.zoom.us, you can click "Host" to start a meeting.
    - You can start an "anonymous" meeting or one with your Personal Meeting ID.
5. Get set up in the meeting, checking audio and turning on video using the controls at the bottom of the application window.  If you want to set up a virtual background, you could do that before you start as well.
6. Record
    - Hit the record button, the red circle icon.
        - You may be given a choice on recording to the local computer or to the cloud.  Select to your local computer.
    - During recording, you can pause and resume the recording using the controls in the upper left.
    - The filled square in the controls in the upper left will stop the recording.
7. When you "End" the meeting, the video will be saved by converting and downloading the video format.  When complete, it should navigate you to a file explorer that contains the .mp4 video file.
