## Process and Schedule

This is about **individuals** using our class-developed rubric and assessing the Ignite Paired Presentations.

The students in the odd numbered Groups for this assignment (from Notebowl) will be assessing the submissions from the even numbered groups, and the students from the even numbered Groups will be assessing the submissions from the odd numbered groups.

After we have gone through instructions, **each individual student** will do the following:

1. Go to their individually assigned breakout room (from rooms 1 through 16).
2. Share their screen within the breakout room.
3. For *each Ignite video* you are responsible for assessing:
    - Find and open **your** rubric for this particular video.
    - Put your name at the top as the Assessor.
    - Watch the five minute video without stopping, but taking notes either on the rubric form, blank note paper, and/or on the rubric questions document.
    - Collect your thoughts and fill in  **exactly one** checkbox for **every** criteria.  Add comments to help explain or justify why you thought a criteria was not applicable or you could not judge.  Do not do this lightly.
    - Add constructive criticism suggesting **actionable and specific** suggestions for improving and making the communication more effective.
    - Please use the ability to move through the video and even cite particular timestamps for both comments and constructive criticism.

This should take approximately 45 minutes if students are doing a good job.

**After you have evaluated all the videos**, then  all odd-numbered Group members will gather in Breakout 17, and all even-numbered Group members will gather in Breakout 18.

This will be at approximately 12:20 pm.

There, you will discuss each video, in turn, and see what you found in common and what you differ on in your assessment.  Talk about the constructive criticism.  You can **revise** your own rubric based on what you agree with in the group setting.  Remember that I can see the revision history on each document, so if you stall and wait for the group to meet to "discover" your constructive criticism, it will be painfully obvious to me.

I will be moving between breakout rooms throughout.

After you are done, you need not wait for the class to reconvene, but you should make sure that I am aware that your half of the class has completed its work.
