# Resources for Talk Subjects

> Topics and Resources **must be approved for use** in your short or long talk.

## Mathematics

- **Heart of Mathematics** by Burger and Starbird, ISBN-13: 978-1931914413.

- We Use Math [website](http://weusemath.org/).  Section on "Math Tidbits" may have some topics appropriate for a short talk.

- I am currently soliciting pointers from our mathematics professors; Dr. Wolff used a number of statistics and modeling textbooks the last time she taught 395 that might be interesting.

- Possible Talk on specific proof
    - Rolle's Theorem
    - Intermediate Value Theorem
    - Unicity of Zero Theorem
    - Lagrange Theorem
    - Proof that the square root of 2 is irrational
    - Proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers
    - the last two are introduced in section 1.1 of Stephen Abbot's **Understanding Analysis**, ISBN-13: 978-1493927111

## Computer Science

> Papers published by the primary CS academic society, ACM, are almost always in the ACM Digital Library.  See Dr. B on determining availability for a particular paper.

- **Introduction to Algorithms** by Corman, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, ISBN: 978-0-262-03384-8
    - Randomized Algorithms/Probabilistic Analysis
    - Red-Black Trees
    - Fibonacci Heaps
    - Maximum Flow
    - Polynomials and the FFT
    - and many more ...

- Proceedings from SOSP in any recent years (odd numbered years).  See [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/)

- Proceedings from OSDI in any recent years (even numbered years).  Many complete papers are available [here](https://www.usenix.org/publications/proceedings/OSDI)

- Any ACM **Journal** (not Communications of the ACM or other trade-magazine). ... ACM Transactions on Computing Systems is my own favorite, but any of them are high quality research.  Also can be searched in the ACM Digital Library.

- I am currently soliciting pointers from our more algorithm- and theory-centric professors.
